  <h1><%= title "5 Tips for Creating Community Allies" %></h1>

<p>New organizers often underestimate the power of community support in their fight to improve the workplace. This oversight can be costly, because management is fully aware of public opinion's crucial role and will actively work to turn your community against your unionization effort.</p>
<p>To counter the boss's strategy and build a robust movement for positive change, workers must proactively engage with their communities, so they can present a united front that amplifies their message.</p>
<p>After reading this blog post, you'll be able to build an extensive network of community supporters who will stand by you throughout your journey towards a better workplace. So let's dive in and explore how you can transform your community into a powerful ally for your union campaign.</p>

<h2>Tip #1: Don't Ignore Your Community– Your Bosses Sure Won't!</h2>

<p>As soon as management learns about your union drive, they're likely to spring into action, employing a variety of tactics to discourage your coworkers from forming a union. One of their most effective strategies is to sway public opinion against your union by targeting employees' families, community groups, local politicians, and other influential figures in your town.</p>
<p>They may distribute biased information, host anti-union meetings, or even go door-to-door to spread misinformation about your union and your intentions. By doing so, management aims to create a divisive atmosphere that turns neighbors against each other and makes workers feel isolated in their quest for collective power.</p>
<p>To counteract these tactics and protect your union efforts, it's vital to proactively engage with your community. Don't wait for the company's propaganda machine to start churning out misleading information. Instead, get out there and present your side of the story!</p>
<p>By taking the initiative and engaging with your community early on, you can create a counter-narrative to management's anti-union propaganda. This proactive approach will help build understanding, foster solidarity, and strengthen your union's position in the eyes of the public.</p>

<h2>Tip #2: Connect With Your Community Through Shared Concerns</h2>

<p>Management's divisive tactics often focus on painting unions as outsiders or even enemies of the community. To counter this narrative and foster genuine support for your union, it's essential to find common ground between workers and their neighbors. By identifying shared concerns and issues that impact both employees and the broader community, you can build bridges of understanding and solidarity.</p>
<p>Finding these shared interests is not as difficult as it may seem. Frequently, the same problems that drive workers to create a union also affect their communities. For instance, consider teachers who are organizing to improve their working conditions. By connecting with parents on the issue of reducing class sizes or increasing educational resources, these educators can highlight how their struggle directly impacts students' learning experiences and the overall well-being of the community.</p>
<p>Similarly, healthcare workers fighting for better staffing ratios can engage with patients and families by emphasizing how a better nurse-to-patient ratio leads to improved medical outcomes and safer hospitals. This shared concern creates a natural bond between workers and their community, making it easier to build alliances and gain support for unionization efforts.</p>
<p>By focusing on shared concerns, you can transform the narrative around your union campaign, presenting it not as a threat but as a shared opportunity for collective progress and improvement.</p>
<p>Keep shared opportunities at the core of your community conversations to build strong, enduring relationships and foster union support. Together, your united front with the community will be far more resilient against management's divisive tactics and far better equipped to advocate for positive change in your workplace and beyond.</p>

<h2>Tip #3: Engage the Organic Leaders in Your Community</h2>

<p>It's essential to recognize the power of your community's <%= link_to "organic leaders", blog_tips_for_organic_leader_identification_path %>- individuals who already hold sway and command respect within their circles, such as religious leaders, parent-teacher association (PTA) presidents, student body leaders, neighborhood council members, or even local politicians. Just as recruiting the organic leaders in your workplace can significantly boost your organizing drive, so too can enlisting the the organic leaders in your community.</p>
<p>The organic leaders in your community possess a unique ability to inspire and mobilize their followers around shared causes. By winning over these leaders, you can unlock the support of entire networks with far greater efficiency than trying to convince each community member one by one.</p>
<p>There are clear parallels between recruiting organic leaders within the workplace and within the community. In both cases, you're tapping into established social structures and leveraging pre-existing relationships to build momentum for your cause. Just as a respected worker can rally their colleagues around unionization, a respected community leader can spur their followers to back your campaign.</p>
<p>When engaging with the organic leaders in your community, approach them with respect and a genuine desire to collaborate. Bring up your shared concerns, shared opportunities, and how their support can make a significant difference in your shared success.</p>
<p>For instance, consider a group of teachers organizing their school. To generate broader community support, they might reach out to the president of their school's PTA, who's already trusted and respected by many parents. By persuading this one person to champion their cause, they gain immediate access to a vast network of sympathetic ears, greatly accelerating their efforts to convert parents into community allies.</p>

<h2>Tip #4: Tap into Your Coworkers' Existing Social Networks</h2>

<p>Your coworkers are not merely professionals. They have whole lives outside the workplace and are deeply embedded in many different social networks- families, friends, religious communities, sports leagues, volunteer groups, and more. These connections represent powerful avenues for engaging with the broader community and building support for your cause.</p>
<p>When deciding who should reach out to a given organic leader in your community, prefer coworkers who already have close ties to that leader's social group. For example, a church-going coworker will be able to engage their minister far more effectively than someone with no connection to the congregation. Similarly, it's much easier for a coworker who's already involved in their child's PTA to connect with the PTA president than it would be for another coworker who has no relationship with the PTA at all.</p>
<p>By leveraging these established connections, you can create a more natural and effective bridge between your workplace and the community at large.</p>

<h2>Tip #5: Activate Community Allies to Amplify Your Impact</h2>

<p>When planning a large labor action such as a strike, you must anticipate how the effects of your work-stopage will extend beyond the workplace and into your community. That's because your community's reaction to those effects has the power to make or break the whole strike. By engaging with your community early and securing their support, you can multiply the disruptive impact of your strike and ensure that it works for, rather than against, your cause.</p>
<p>For example, a teachers' strike could force students' parents to find alternative childcare arrangements, potentially making the parents miss work too. So it's critical that the teachers convert the parents into community allies before the strike begins. As community allies who understand and support the teachers' goals, the parents would likely channel their frustrations towards pressuring management to negotiate fairly. However, if the parents were not converted to community allies and remained uninformed or unsympathetic about the reasons behind the strike, their anger would probably be directed at the striking teachers instead, undermining the whole effort.</p>
<p>By activating community allies, you create a web of support that strengthens your hand at the bargaining table and sends a clear message to management: their actions have consequences that ripple far beyond the workplace. This amplified collective power can prove decisive in winning fair agreements and securing long-term improvements for workers and the wider community.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Community allies will play an important role in your union campaign. By fostering strategic partnerships with community leaders, tapping into coworkers' social networks, and activating community allies, you can amplify your collective power and transform isolated workplace struggles into broad-based movements for positive change.</p>
<p>Remember, building effective community alliances takes time and sustained effort. Don't wait until a large labor action is imminent– start cultivating these crucial relationships early in your organizing efforts. By doing so, you'll create a resilient support network that empowers workers and magnifies your collective power at the negotiating table and beyond.</p>
