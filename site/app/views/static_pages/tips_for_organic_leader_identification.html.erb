<p>Unions are built on relationships- one person, one conversation, and one connection at a time. While <%= link_to "1-on-1 organizing conversations", blog_tips_for_organizing_conversations_path %> are essential to any successful union drive, they're also incredibly time-consuming. As such, it's just not possible to have a meaningful 1-on-1 with everyone at your workplace.</p>
<p>That's where <em>organic leaders</em> come in- individuals who naturally inspire and lead a group of coworkers at your workplace. Identifying organic leaders is game-changing because it allows you to focus on building relationships with them, instead of trying to reach everyone individually. Once you convince an organic leader to join in, it'll be a breeze for them to convince the rest of their group to join too.</p>
<p>However, identifying the right people takes skill. Incorrectly identifying organic leaders wastes valuable time and can even harm the unionization drive. That's why it's crucial to get this part right. In this post, we'll share six tips to help you correctly identify the organic leaders at your workplace.</p>

<h2>Tip #1: Create a Company Map of Your Workplace</h2>

<p>Before you try to identify organic leaders, it's helpful to identify the organic groups of workers that naturally form at your workplace. A <em>company map</em> is a drawing of your workplace that helps you visualize those groups.</p>
<p>Every company has its own unique landscape of <em>work groups</em> and <em>social groups</em>. Management divides workers into work groups based on job functions, each with its own manager. Meanwhile, workers tend to self-organize into social groups around shared interests, hobbies, or personal connections. For example, some coworkers go to the same church, commute on the same bus, or play the same sport together. A company map is often better for visualizing work groups, whereas an employee directory, discussed in Tip #2, is often better for exploring social groups.</p>
<p>Don't try to do this by yourself! Enlisting the help of other organizers will be beneficial, since they will have a broader understanding of different areas of the workplace and be a part of more groups than you are individually.</p>
<p>First, sketch the physical space where you work, including relevant rooms and office features where people tend to congregate. For example, a company map of a grocery store would include the checkout area, aisles, loading bays, storage rooms, break rooms, etc. You're eventually going to include a labeled dot for each worker, so use multiple sheets of paper to make it big enough, and then make copies for each shift.</p>
<p>Next, make a comprehensive list of all the workers at your workplace. This will help ensure that you don't leave anyone out during the next step. This may require some creative problem-solving, such as taking a photo of the shift schedule.</p>
<p>Now you're ready to add dots with names to your drawing- one for each worker. Place each worker in the area of the map where they usually operate. If a worker moves around a lot, or you're unsure where they work, consider making their dot from a sticky note, so you can move it around later.</p>
<p>Finally, draw loops around people who form work groups. Try to come up with a descriptive label for each group such as cashiers, welders, salesmen, etc. While working through this step, discuss each group with your fellow organizers and try to identify potential organic leaders together. If someone seems like an obvious candidate, mark them with a star or bright color so they visually stand out from the rest.</p>

<h2>Tip #2: Create an Employee Directory for Your Workplace</h2>

<p>After you've used your company map to start identifying organic leaders among work groups, it's time to switch gears and make an <em>employee directory</em> to identify organic leaders among social groups.</p>
<p>An employee directory is a spreadsheet that acts as a searchable database of your workplace's social landscape. It contains rows for each worker, with columns for their name, contact information, groups they're part of, and any groups they're an organic leader of.</p>
<p>We've created an example employee directory spreadsheet to get you started- <%= link_to "view it", "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JVuUkOr43eh-5GM_h4fFZqJVkLg--97e7nkllgxPW08/view", target: "_blank" %> or <%= link_to "make a copy", "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JVuUkOr43eh-5GM_h4fFZqJVkLg--97e7nkllgxPW08/copy", target: "_blank" %>. Check out how its "Group Explorer" tab lets you select any group to see its members and any organic leaders you've identified. This is incredibly handy for exploring groups that can't easily be identified using the company map.</p>
<p>Once you've got a feel for how the example employee directory works, start replacing the example employees with the real employees at your workplace. Reuse the comprehensive list of employees you made earlier to make sure you don't forget anyone! You can also use the company map to add the work groups associated with each employee.</p>
<p>Even though it involves a bit of setup and effort to keep it up-to-date, the employee directory is one of the most important tools in an organizer's toolbox thanks to its versatility. As your campaign evolves, it can too. For example, you could add a column to track whether each employee participated in the last structure test.</p>
<p>Just be careful of who you share it with! The employee directory contains personal information about all of your coworkers, so you don't want it to fall into the wrong hands.</p>

<h2>Tip #3: Ask Coworkers Who They Turn To</h2>

<p>At this point, you've used the company map and employee directory to identify organic leaders for many of the organic groups at your company. However, there are always groups left over where it's tough to determine a leader. So what's your next move? Talk to workers in those groups!</p>
<p>When talking to coworkers from a particular group, ask questions like "Who do you turn to when you need help understanding something at work?" or "Who helps you make sense of things around here?"</p>
<p>Pay attention to their response, and see if there's someone who keeps popping up as the go-to person. This is likely an organic leader in that group. Why? Because people tend to seek out individuals they respect and trust for guidance. By asking these questions, you'll start to get a sense of who the most influential people are within each group.</p>
<p>And remember, these aren't necessarily the people in charge or with formal leadership roles. Instead they're the people who naturally rise up as sources of information and support among their peers.</p>

<h2>Tip #4: Look for People Respected by Both Workers and Management</h2>

<p>As you continue to identify organic leaders, it's essential to look beyond their influence within the group itself. Are they just popular among their peers or do they also earn the respect of management?</p>
<p>Organic leaders tend to be hardworking, experienced employees who consistently demonstrate a high level of professionalism. As such, it's common for them to have built strong relationships with management as well. When you see an individual who is respected by both workers and management, take note!</p>
<p>A key benefit of identifying organic leaders who are respected by both workers and management is that it's harder for management to retaliate against them when they speak out. When a person has a reputation as a hard worker, it's much more difficult for management to claim they're being "unreasonable" or "just making trouble". Instead, their complaints carry weight because of the context: this person has consistently demonstrated themselves to be responsible and reliable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, management is also less likely to dismiss the concerns of a respected individual as mere whining. When someone who's earned the respect of both workers and management speaks out, it's harder for management to characterize their words as "just complaints" or "personal gripes". This makes it more difficult for them to ignore legitimate issues and more likely that they'll take meaningful action to address concerns and improve working conditions.</p>

<h2>Tip #5: Don't Assume They're Your Most Vocal Supporters</h2>

<p>When identifying an organic leader in each group, it's easy to assume that they'll be the group's most enthusiastic supporter when it comes to forming a union. But this assumption often leads to disappointment and missed opportunities.</p>
<p>In reality, most organic leaders won't support the union at first. This might seem counterintuitive, but consider this: as hardworking, experienced employees who are respected by management, they likely feel that they're already doing okay without the union's help. They're probably winning small concessions from their managers, like desirable shifts or slightly better pay, making them feel like they should keep their head down instead of rocking the boat.</p>
<p>Fortunately this is exactly the mindset that 1-on-1 organizing conversations and the <%= link_to " AEIOU framework", blog_aeiou_framework_path %> are intended to sway. In short, they help your coworker realize that while they may be able to win small victories individually, the only way to win large victories in the workplace is by joining together in collective action.</p>

<h2>Tip #6: Prove Your Picks with Structure Tests</h2>

<p>So far we've discussed many tips for identifying <em>potential</em> organic leaders, but there's really only one way to determine whether you picked correctly or not- you've got to put them to the test.</p>
<p>Structure tests are public actions that demonstrate your coworkers' growing confidence in each other's collective power, like signing a petition against the boss, wearing a union sticker, or attending a pro-union rally. By participating in structure tests, each coworker risks punishment from the boss, which shows how strong their commitment really is.</p>
<p>Structure tests are great for gaguing your organization's overall strength, but they're also perfect for measuring how effective each of the potential organic leaders you identified is at actually inspiring their colleages to take action. If one fails to convince most of their colleagues to join in a structure test, it's time to focus on finding a better organic leader among that group. On the other hand, if 90% of that group joins in, you can be confident that they have what it takes to drive your unionization effort forward.</p>
